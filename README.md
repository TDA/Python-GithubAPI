## My GitHub Contribution graph
* This repo is a set of repos that are going to help me find out which languages I code a lot in.
* True to being a polyglot, I have decided to start this with Python (Requests Lib is toooo good to miss up)
* I will probably continue with either Ruby or JS to parse the JSON into a dictionary, JS cause its the 
natural language for JSON, but inclined towards Ruby as I am learning it right now (and cuz Polyglot).
* WIll probably end up doing visualization with JS, been wanting to learn d3 for sometime, and cause I want to touch up on Angular.

### This is the first repo, to check the other ones, go here:
